# SSC

A good place to start to understand the code is from example_clusters.m. I still
need to add further documentation. ncutsK_v5 is interactive code. This is largely
for visualization and inspection.

The main function for usage is sncut(W,K) where W is the weight matrix and K
is the number of clusters.

Please send questions to Joao Sedoc (joao at cis dot upenn dot edu).

# TBD: I will move the code for the paper to be under the folder synonym_clusters
